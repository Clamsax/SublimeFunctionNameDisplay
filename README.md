Sublime Function Name Display
=============================

This plugin displays the current class and function name on the status bar in Sublime Text 2.

Installation
------------

We're waiting to be added to [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control), so for now you'll need to clone this repo into your Sublime Text 2 "Packages/" folder.

Limitations
-----------
This plugin looks for Sublime's 'entity.name.type.class' and 'entity.name.function' scopes to work out where a class and function starts. Note that it doesn't determine where the class/function ends.
